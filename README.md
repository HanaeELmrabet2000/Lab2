<h1>Lab 2: NLP Rule-Based Techniques and Word Embedding</h1>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The primary goal of this lab was to explore two key aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP): Rule-Based Techniques using Regular Expressions (Regex), and Word Embedding methodologies.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Rule-Based NLP and Regex</h2>

<li>Developed a Python script to automate the creation of a bill from raw text, leveraging Regex for pattern matching.</li>
<li>Identified and extracted key information such as product names, quantities, and prices from unstructured text.</li>
<li>Structured the parsed data into a well-formatted bill, allowing for easier comprehension and analysis.</li>

<h2>Part 2: Word Embedding</h2>

<li>Applied a range of word embedding techniques including one-hot encoding, bag of words, and TF-IDF on the dataset obtained in Lab 1.</li>
<li>Implemented advanced methods such as Word2Vec (Skip Gram, CBOW), GloVe, and FastText for semantic representation of words.</li>
<li>Utilized the t-SNE algorithm to visualize the embedded vectors, enabling a comparative analysis of various techniques.</li>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<li>his lab provided valuable hands-on experience in both Rule-Based NLP and Word Embedding, which are essential components of NLP.</li>T

<li>TEnhanced understanding of Regex and its application in text processing tasks, leading to efficient information extraction from unstructured data.</li>T
<li>TExplored the nuances of word embedding techniques, gaining insights into their respective roles and effectiveness in capturing semantic information.</li>T
<li>TGained practical skills in implementing NLP methodologies, laying the groundwork for further exploration and application in text analysis and processing tasks.</li>T
